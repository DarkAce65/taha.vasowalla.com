However, with Digication they appear to provide support for changing styles on your portfolio, but it's not truly available. In web development, styles are added to pages via files written in CSS. Digication does allow you to add in your own CSS stylesheet, but it doesn't evaluate what you type in correctly.

An idea I found an interest in stemmed from the fact that I'm always looking for music that both sounds good and has sheet music available. Unfortunately, good sheet music is often difficult to find or costs money to get access to. If a natural language processor was retrained with musical instruments instead of voices and could identify the notes being played, it might be able to generate sheet music for each part on its own which be extremely useful.</p>"
