						<h1>Hypothermia</h1>
						<p>Many Kemp's Ridley turtles are found stranded on Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts. Kemp's Ridley turtles are found to have been exposed to hypothermia and they sometimes do not make it to the rescue center in time. The Turtle Stretcher designed by the JAYS could help to decrease the chances of sea turtles dying when they are being transported to the rescue center because the stretcher will keep the turtles from freezing even more and more comfortable. The community could participate in this effort of rescuing the sea turtles by being more aware of this problem, being more alert to look out for stranded turtles, and knowing that this Turtle Stretcher may be made available at the nearest lifeguard station.</p>

						<h1>JAYS's Solution</h1>
						<p>This project concept was to build a carrier to increase the survival rate of Kemp's Ridley sea turtles during the rescue phase, which is the transportation to the rescue center. The JAYS team came up with the solution of building a carrier with heating capabilities, so that rescuers could provide appropriate heating for the turtles during the transportation.</p>

				<h1>Brainstorming Process</h1>
				<p>All JAYS members were involved in brainstorming ways to decrease the number of Kemp's Ridley sea turtles with hypothermia dying on the way to the rescue clinic. In our brainstorming sessions, we discussed how experts could help provide more information, who could benefit from using our device, and considering the most durable yet affordable materials to build our prototype. We listened to everyone's ideas and suggestions, and eventually ended up with a result, which each team member contributed to. Each of us brought something unique to the table, making our result even better each time. One example is when we were deciding the design for our device. At first, we planned on making a Turtle Pouch, as we called it. It would be a pouch where you could put the Kemp's Ridley sea turtles. After realizing that it would be hard to carry, we brainstormed more ideas to solve this. Soon, we came to the conclusion to design and build the Turtle Stretcher. After this draft, we realized that the Turtle Stretchers might not be easy to stack on trucks. So we brainstormed again. We decided that railings would be the answer, as you can see in the pictures under the Engineering Design. Now, the Turtle Stretchers can be stacked and easily carried.</p>

				<h1>Dedication</h1>
				<p>Since November, the team met four days a week at school in science class to briefly discuss how our work was going. We also met outside of class throughout the development of this project. In total, for outside meetings, we met one time during lunch, and four times over the weekends and breaks. We organized all our ideas, research and designs in a folder. Once we planned the materials we needed, we made a trip as a team to the local home improvement store to purchase what we needed. In two of our meetings outside of school, we built our prototype of the Turtle Stretcher. In total, the building of the prototype took eight hours. We had a few hiccups, for example, when a team member realized the originally planned material might not be the most effective due to possible corrosion. However, we improvised and solved the problem by weatherproofing it.</p>
